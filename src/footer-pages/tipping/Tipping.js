                                <p>We follow Kilimanjaro Porters Assistance Program (KPAP) recommended guidelines on all aspects of guide and porter payments and welfare. KPAP publish recommended tipping amounts for all operators which we adopt.</p>
                                <p>Recommending tipping amounts for Climbing Kilimanjaro are the same no matter which route you end up choosing.</p>
                               
                                <h2>You should tip:</h2>
                                <p>1. Lead guide: $20/day</p>
                                <p>2. Assistant guide: $15/day</p>
                                <p>3. Porters: $8/day (for each porter)</p>
                                <p>4. Cook: $15/day</p>

                                <p>These amounts are per group of climbers NOT per climber. You will be advised of the total size of your crew in your final briefing pack.</p>

                                <p>As a general guide for a climb for two people over 7 days, a normal crew would comprise 1 lead guide, 1 assistant guide, 1 cook and 6 to 7 porters. If your climb is longer then the number of porters will increase as more food will need to be carried for everyone. Also, if you have booked a private toilet there will an additional toilet porter who carries the equipment and makes sure itâ€™s kept clean.</p>

                                <p>Tips should be paid to the lead guide on the morning of the last day of the climb. The lead guide will then distribute tips according to our strict policy.</p>
