                    <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>The iconic parks of the American Southwest speak directly to women drawn to the dramatic desert landscape. The red sandstone spires, hoodoos and impossibly balanced boulders and formations of Arches and Canyonlands National Park create an enormous and often unbelievable open-air gallery.</span></p>
                    <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>We’ll explore the parks in the most intimate ways–rappelling into carved canyons, rafting the mighty Colorado and hiking a network of trails that lead to some of the most famed arches and pinnacles.</span></p>
                    <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>This Wild Women road trip is designed for adrenaline-junkies, geology nerds and those who ask for “more desert” instead of dessert (but you can certainly have your cake and eat it too on this trip).&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>We’ll experience the natural oddities of Island in the Sky and the Needles district, known for its peculiar potholes, petroglyphs and slickrock. In no time you’ll know your mesas from your buttes and your butt from your legs after a day of canyoneering!</span></p>
                    <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>This itinerary is jam-packed with activity and challenge with well-deserved pampering at day’s end! We’ll do this Wild Women Southwest road trip in total style and stay in yurts for a ‘soft cowgirl’ kind of experience.</span></p>
                    <p><span style={{fontWeight: "400"}}>Ready to rappel into this one? This trip is a brand new addition to our signature trips line-up–are you ready to rock and roll with us?</span></p>
